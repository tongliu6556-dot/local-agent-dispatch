# Architecture

`local-agent-dispatch` is a local control plane with explicit provider and
compute boundaries. The packaged `lad` command is intentionally thin; the
provider-free path can be run on a machine with no credentials or network.

             state.json runs) or explicit JSON controller

```

Discovery is an explicit subsystem, not a collection of provider-specific
guesses. The Evidence Discovery and Compatibility Resolver searches official
documentation/source and local versioned capabilities first, ranks evidence,
then performs only bounded, authorized probes. It records catalog, auth, quota,
runtime, transport, resource, and policy evidence separately with source,
version, TTL, confidence, and discrepancy fields. A catalog hit never implies
that a request is accepted or that a numeric balance is available. See
`docs/research/evidence-discovery-subsystem.md`.

The planner has two placement fields: `execution_host` is where an
authenticated desktop CLI or server adapter runs, while `workload_host` is
where data/compute is consumed. A split placement requires an explicit
workload wrapper and telemetry; otherwise the bridge or monitor fails closed.

Provider pools represent shared quota, not individual model IDs. Model
catalog visibility, authentication, runtime acceptance, and numeric quota are
separate evidence fields. Unknown quota is blocked unless a preflight policy
explicitly grants a bounded pilot.

## Plugin boundary

`src/local_agent_dispatch/plugins/` is the package-level Phase 2 seam. It
defines five explicit stdlib-only protocols—`SystemProbe`, `ProviderAdapter`,
`RuntimeAdapter`, `TransportAdapter`, and `Validator`—plus typed request/result
objects, an API-versioned descriptor, and an explicit `PluginRegistry`.
Registration and conformance are metadata-only: no provider prompt, network
connection, SSH session, subprocess, or model runtime starts merely because a
plugin is present. Provider discovery is split into catalog, auth, quota, and
runtime evidence so one failed probe cannot fabricate another status. A
controller may invoke a registered operation only after its normal lease,
policy, path, and quota gates; a crashing plugin is isolated to an invocation
failure result. Existing standalone scripts remain compatible while their
provider/host calls are migrated behind this seam in a later Phase 2 step.

The `auto` backend is SQLite-first for new queues. It provides WAL
transactions, lease fencing, atomic claim/complete, idempotent events, and
stale-job recovery. Transient retryable failures are persisted with a
`retry_at_utc` gate and bounded exponential backoff, so a durable worker does
not hot-loop against a rate-limited provider or unhealthy host. An explicit,
approved replan may still fencedly requeue a terminal job immediately. If a
supplied run directory already contains
`state.json` (and no SQLite database), `auto` preserves that JSON controller
for migration; `--backend json` remains an explicit escape hatch for older
prepared runs.
